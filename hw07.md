1、Program with machine language according to the following c. 
int_8 a = 1;  

int_8 c = a + 3;  

1）Write your assembly code & machine code 

|    LDA `0x0001,i`   | 

|    STA `0x0061,d`   | 

|    LDA `0x0003,i`   | 

|    STA `0x0062,d`   | 

|    ADD `0x0061,d`   | 

|    STA `0x0063,d`   | 

|     STOP            |   

machine code：

0xc0  0x0001

0xe1  0x0002

0xc0  0x0003

0x71  0x0002

0xe1  0x0006

0x00  0x0000

2）Explain machine code execution with the fetch-decode-execute cycle 

1.Load Instruction from IR.

2.Load Data to ACC register.

3.Load Instruction from IR

4.Stored Date(3) to memory with specific address(a)

3）Explain functions about  IR, PC, ACC registers in a CPU 

IR (Instruction Register): A temporary holding ground for the instruction that has just been fetched from memory.

PC (Program Counter): An incrementing counter that keeps track of the memory address of the instruction that is to be executed next or in other words, holds the address of the instruction to be executed next.

ACC (Accumulator register): In a computer’s central processing unit (CPU), an accumulator is a register in which intermediate arithmetic and logic results are stored.

4）Explain physical meaning about vars a & c in a machine

address

2、简答题 

1）What are stored in memory? 

Data and Instruction

2）Can a data or a instruction stored in the same place? 

No,they can't.

3） Explain Instruction Format with example instructions.

For example, I need to load number 1 in register A, the assembly code is LDA #1, the Instruction specifier is 11100000, the Operand specifier is 0000000000000001; In instruction specifier, the first 4~5 bits are Operation code, the 1100 means LDA, the last bit 0 means operating a number instead of address

3、解释以下词汇 

1）汇编语言（Assembly Language） 

An assembly language, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program’s statements and the architecture’s machine code instructions.

汇编语言是一种低级编程语言，其程序语句与机械代码指令之间有非常紧密的对应关系。

2）编译（Compiler） 

A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program.

编译器是一种电脑程序，他能够将高级语言转换成低级的机械编码，并且创造一个exe（可执行）程序。

3）命令式语言（Imperative programming） 

In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program’s state.

在计算机科学中，命令式编程是一种编程范式，它使用能够改变程序状态的语句。

4）函数编程语言（Functional programming） 

In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

在计算机科学中，函数式编程是一种编程范式，它通过构建计算机程序结构和元素，将计算视为数学函数并且避免改变状态和可改变的数据。

5）过程式编程（Procedural programming）

Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call.

过程式编程源于结构化编程，是一种基于过程调用的概念的编程范式。
