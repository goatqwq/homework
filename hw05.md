7) Logical binary operations can be used to modify bit pattern. 

Such as (X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 and (00001111)2= (0000X4X3X2X1)2 

We called that (00001111)2 is a mask which only makes low 4 bits to work. 

Fill the follow expression 

(1)  (X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 or (00001111)2 = (X8X7X6X51111)2 

(2)  (X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 xor (00001111)2 = (X8X7X6X5X4'X3'X2'X1')2 

(3)  ((X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 and(11110000)2 ) or  (not (X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 and (00001111)2)  =  (X8X7X6X5X4'X3'X2'X1')2
